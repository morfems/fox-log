# fox-log

A program that generate and consumes an actively written-to w3c-formatted HTTP access log.

Every 10 seconds this program displays statistics about the traffic during those 10 seconds:<br/>
â€¢ Sections of the web site that are the most visited.<br/>
â€¢ Error rates by sections.

Whenever total traffic for the past 2 minutes exceeds a certain number on average, add a message saying that:<br/>
â€¢ High traffic generated an alert - hits = {value}<br/>
Exemple : <br/>
```
[2020-03-03T22:35:08.904] [WARN ] [LOG MONITOR] - High traffic generated an alert - hits = 12
```

Whenever the total traffic drops again below that value on average for the past 2 minutes, another message is displayed detailing when the alert recovered.<br/>
Exemple : <br/>
```
[2020-03-03T22:35:08.904] [INFO ] [LOG MONITOR] - Traffic is back to normal - at = 7 ðŸ¥³ðŸ˜º
```
